	/// OK, just what the heck *is* one of these "lambda" things? Well, MS
	/// defines a lambda (or, more correctly, a "lambda expression") as follows:
	/// 
	/// "A lambda expression is an anonymous function that you can use to create 
	/// delegates or expression tree types. By using lambda expressions, you can 
	/// write local functions that can be passed as arguments or returned as the
	/// value of function calls. Lambda expressions are particularly helpful for
	/// writing LINQ query expressions."
	/// 
	/// Great! But what does that actually mean? Well, technically, a lambda is
	/// syntactic suger designed to hide and consolidate the process of creating
	/// a delagate, assigning a function to the delegate and then calling that
	/// function via the delegate. Example 1 shows the "old" way of doing things
	/// (a way, which is Just Fine to use nowadays - there are places where this
	/// syntax is perfectly acceptable!)
	/// 
	/// Here is a good alternate resource that explains the above a little 
	/// differently: http://www.tutorialsteacher.com/linq/linq-lambda-expression

		// OK, so what's all this "Func<int, int>" stuff? This is the way that MS

		// both declaring a delagate AND assigning functionality to said delegate.
		// The "Func" portion tells the compiler that what is wanted is a method
		// with a return result that is NOT void (the TResult declaration). They
		// cheated by combining this with generics such that all they need do is
		// delcare a number of Func<T, TResult> "types" and then teach the compiler
		// how to interpret them. Note that the Func<T...T16, TResult> declarations
		// only go to 16. You want more, you have to write your own. BUT, IF YOU
		// ARE WRITING SOLID CODE, THEN WHAT THE HECK ARE YOU DOING PASSING IN
		// MORE THAN 16 PARAMETERS IN THE FIRST PLACE!? DON'T DO THAT!

		// And here, finally, is where lambdas start coming in to their own. When

		// makes both the algorithm as a whole and the processing of each item

		// DELEGATES IN DISGUISE! (<= theme music from "Transformers").

		// will be called AGAINST EACH ITEM IN THE LIST and the results returned
		// as appropriate.
		// The short version here is that I want to add up all the even numbers in
		// the list. So, my filter is: is it even? If yes, add it to the running
		// total, if not, add 0. And that is easily seen in the function below
		// simply because it's virtually the only thing in the function. None of
		// the list processing code is declared, it's all handled by the "Sum"
		// extension method which takes in a list and processes the lambda against
		// each item in the list. Since the lambda returns only the even numbers,
		// the list gets totaled as all even numbers. Viola! Syntactic sugar that
